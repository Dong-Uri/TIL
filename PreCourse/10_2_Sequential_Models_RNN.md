- Sequential Model
  - Naive sequence model
  - Autoregressive model
  - Markov model (first-order autoregressive model)
  - Latent autoregressive model
- Recurrent Neural Network
  - Short-term dependencies
  - Long-term dependencies
- Long Short Term Memory
  - Forget Gate
    - Decide which information to throw away
  - Input Gate
    - Decide which information to store in the cell state
  - Update cell
    - Update the cell state
  - Output Gate
    - Make output using the updated cell state
- Gated Recurrent Unit
  - Simpler architecture with two gates (reset gate and update gate)
  - No cell state, just hidden state
