- Convolution
  - Continous convolution
  - Discrete convolution
  - 2D image convolution
- RGB Image Convolution
- Stack of Convolutions
- Convolutional Neural Networks
  - CNN consists of convolution layer, pooling layer, and fully connected layer
    - Convolution and pooling layer: feature extraction
    - Fully connected layer: decision making (e.g., classification)
- Stride
- Padding
- Convolution Arithmetic
- 1x1 Convolution
  - Dimension reduction
  - To reduce the number of parameters while increasing the depth
  - e.g., bottleneck architecture
