- Neural Networks

  - Neural networks are computing systems vaguely inspired by the biological neural networks that constitute animal brains
  - Neural networks are function approximations that stack affine transformation followed by nonlinear transformations

- Linear Neural Networks

  - We compute the partial derivatives w.r.t. the optimization variables
  - Then, we iteratively update the optimization variables
  - Of course, we can handle multi dimensional input and output

- Beyond Linear Neural Networks

  - We need nonlinearity
  - Activation functions

- Multi-Layer Perceptron
