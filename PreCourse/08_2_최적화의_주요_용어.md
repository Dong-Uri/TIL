- Gradient Descent
  - First-order iterative optimization algorithm for finding a local minimum of a differentiable function
- Generalization
  - Generalization gap
- Underfitting vs. Overfitting
- Cross-validation
  - Cross-validation is a model validation technique for assessing how the model will generalizee to an independent (test) data set
- Bias and Variance
- Bias and Variance Tradeoff
- Bootstrapping
  - Bootstrapping is any test or metric that uses random sampling with replacement
- Bagging vs. Boosting
  - Bagging (Bootstrapping aggregating)
    - Multiple models are being trained with bootstrapping
  - Boosting
    - It focuses on those specific training samples that are hard to classify
